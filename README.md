# Personal Website (Based on Minimal Light Theme)

This website is built using the open-source **Minimal Light** Jekyll theme created by [Yaoyao Liu](https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/minimal-light), with additional improvements inspired by [Xiao-Chenguang](https://github.com/Xiao-Chenguang/minimal-light).  
The original theme is available here:

I appreciate their elegant and lightweight design — this repository contains my customized version of the theme for my personal academic homepage.
